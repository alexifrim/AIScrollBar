# AIScrollBar

Horizontal scrollable bar with grouped buttons, suitable to replace toolbars where more content is needed.
Other controls can be used separately, such as `AISelectableButton` (button with different background color or overlay when selected), and `AIButtonGroup` (similar behavior to `UISegmentedControl`)


## Requirements

`AIScrollBar` works on iOS 9.0+.


## Adding AIScrollBar to your project

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add *AIScrollBar* to your project.

1. Add a pod entry for AIScrollBar to your Podfile `pod 'AIScrollBar'`
2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.
3. Import the module: `import AIScrollBar` (or `@import AIScrollBar;` in *Objective-C*)
4. [for Objective-C] Make sure `CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES` is set to `YES` in your target build settings. You may also need to add an empty switf file to your project so that swift libraries are linked

### Source files

Alternatively you can directly add the `.swift` from inside the *AIScrollBar* folder to your project, and threat them as any other .swift files.
